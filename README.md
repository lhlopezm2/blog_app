At **kommit**, we provide top software maintenance services for clients across diverse industries.

### So, why do we run an Open-Source Program Office?

First, **kommit** is more than your regular staffing company. We detect talented engineers in developing economies early in their careers and invest in shaping them into world-class professionals.

Second, by contributing to open-source projects, we bring best practices, quality, and third-party vetting to our engineers.

Third, we believe in giving back to the open-source communities.
