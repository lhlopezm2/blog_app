At **kommit**, we provide top software maintenance services for clients across diverse industries.

### So, why do we run an Open-Source Program Office?

First, **kommit** is more than your regular staffing company. We detect talented engineers in developing economies early in their careers and invest in shaping them into world-class professionals.

Second, by contributing to open-source projects, we bring best practices, quality, and third-party vetting to our engineers.

Third, we believe in giving back to the open-source communities.

### What will you find here?

In the following repositories, you will find our award-winning projects and forks to projects we use to contribute to.

We invite you to explore our projects, build with us, get whatever you need, and let us know what we do better. Letâ€™s start!
